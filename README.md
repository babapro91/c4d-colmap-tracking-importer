In his video, Polyfjord built upon the previous automated 3D tracking photogrammetry workflow by introducing GLOMAP instead of just COLMAP. He explains how to download and prepare the necessary tools to make this workflow 100% open source.

## Where this Script Fits
Polyfjord‚Äôs workflow focuses on Blender. However, exporting the tracking from Blender often causes bugs, framerate mismatches, or axis orientation issues when moving into other 3D software.

This Python importer for **Cinema 4D** fills that gap by:
- Building a Redshift-compatible camera with correct baked PSR and focal keyframes.
- Handling axis conversion automatically (COLMAP ‚Üí Cinema 4D).
- Importing sparse point clouds and setting up Matrix objects.
- Creating a constrained duplicate camera for flexible workflows.
- Automatically configuring scene FPS, timeline ranges, and render resolution.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: To visualise the point cloud in the Cinema 4D viewport, you must manually set the **Matrix object Distribution to Vertex**.

## Free Tool & Acknowledgment
This tool is completely **free**. If you use it in your projects, acknowledging **Elderlan Souza** as the creator of the Cinema 4D importer is greatly appreciated (but not compulsory).

Looking forward to seeing what you‚Äôll create using it! ‚ú®

## Setup & Use: AutoTracker v1.4 (.bat)
Follow these steps extracted from the video transcript to configure and run the batch script on Windows (CPU-only, no CUDA required):

1. **Create the project folders**
   - Make a new folder, e.g. `AUTOTRACKER V1.4`.
   - Inside it, create these subfolders (exact names):
     - `01 GLOMAP`
     - `02 VIDEOS`
     - `03 FFMPEG`
     - `04 SCENES`
     - `05 SCRIPT`

2. **Download the tools**
   - COLMAP **v3.12.3** (use this version specifically).
   - GLOMAP **v1.1.0** (`WINDOWS-NOCUDA`).
   - FFMPEG (release essentials build).
   - AutoTracker **v1.4** batch script (save as `.BAT`, not `.TXT`).

3. **Populate `01 GLOMAP` with COLMAP + GLOMAP**
   - Extract the **COLMAP** download and open its `BIN/` folder. Select **all files** in `BIN` and **drag them into** `01 GLOMAP`.
   - Extract the **GLOMAP** download, open its `BIN/` folder, select **all files**, and drag them into `01 GLOMAP` as well. When prompted, **skip identical files**.
   - From the **root** of the extracted COLMAP folder, **copy the entire `PLUGINS/` folder** into `01 GLOMAP` (so `01 GLOMAP/PLUGINS` exists).
   - Result: `01 GLOMAP` should now contain `COLMAP.EXE`, GLOMAP executables, many `.DLL` files, and a `PLUGINS/` folder.

4. **Place your footage**
   - Put your source video file(s) into `02 VIDEOS`.
   - (From the video: disabling in‚Äëcamera stabilization and using a 180¬∞ shutter‚Äîe.g., **1/60** at 30‚ÄØfps‚Äîcan help produce better motion blur for tracking.)

5. **Unpack FFMPEG**
   - Extract the FFMPEG archive and move **its contents** into `03 FFMPEG` (you should see `BIN/` and related files inside `03 FFMPEG`).

6. **Add the batch script**
   - Save **`AUTOTRACKER 1.4.BAT`** into `05 SCRIPT`.
   - Important: when downloading from the browser‚Äôs **RAW** view, some browsers append `.TXT`. Save as **ALL FILES** and make sure the filename **ends with `.BAT`** only.

7. **Run the script**
   - Double‚Äëclick `05 SCRIPT/AUTOTRACKER 1.4.BAT`.
   - The first Windows security prompt may appear; allow it to run.
   - The script will:
     - Use **FFMPEG** to **extract frames** from your video (CPU).
     - Run **COLMAP feature extraction** over the frames.
     - Run **GLOMAP** to reconstruct and produce a track.
   - For faster processing, you can work with **1080P** footage instead of 4K.

8. **Outputs**
   - The script will populate your **`04 SCENES`** folder with the reconstructed project files (per the referenced script‚Äôs defaults).

### Troubleshooting (from the video)
- If the `.BAT` won‚Äôt run, confirm the extension isn‚Äôt `.BAT.TXT` and that SmartScreen isn‚Äôt blocking it.
- CUDA isn‚Äôt required here; the demonstrated workflow runs **CPU‚Äëonly** and is still ~4√ó faster than the older COLMAP‚Äëonly setup.
- If you later import into Blender and see **timing gaps in keyframes**, the video suggests either scaling keyframes by **33%** or importing from `SPARSE/0/` and re‚Äëlinking the background image sequence. (Cinema 4D users can skip Blender and use this importer instead.)

## How to Use the Importer in Cinema 4D
1. Launch **Cinema 4D**.
2. Go to **Extensions ‚Üí Script Manager ‚Üí File ‚Üí Load Script‚Ä¶** and load the Python script `colmap_importer.py`.
3. Run the script from the **Script Manager** or assign it to a shortcut/menu.
4. In the importer dialog:
   - Select your **Scene Folder** (the one containing the `SPARSE` folder and `IMAGES`).
   - Set **Sensor Width (mm)** (typically 36mm for full-frame cameras).
   - Enter your project‚Äôs **Timeline FPS**.
   - Adjust **Global Scale** if needed (default: 100).
   - Optionally, check **Import Sparse Point Cloud**.
5. Click **OK** to import.
6. The script will automatically:
   - Create a **Redshift Camera** with baked animation.
   - Duplicate it and add a **constraint** for flexibility.
   - Import the **sparse point cloud**.
   - Set **scene FPS, timeline, and render resolution**.
   - Attempt to link the **image sequence** to the camera background.
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember:
   - To **see the point cloud in the viewport**, set the **Matrix object Distribution ‚Üí Vertex** manually.
   - To **configure the camera background**, do the following manually:
     - Set **Background ‚Üí Override** on the RS Camera.
     - Select the first frame from the project‚Äôs `IMAGES` folder.
     - Change mode from **Image** to **Animation**.
     - Set **Animation Mode** to **Simple**.
     - Set **Timing** to **Frame**.
     - Press **Detect Frames** to load the sequence.
   - To **adjust the ground plane alignment**, move the **`GLoMap_Import` group**. The **Copy Camera** uses a constraint to follow this transform. If you need to export to other applications, you can bake the Copy Camera‚Äôs final transform after alignment.

### Known Bug: Resolution & Background Distortion
- The scene resolution from COLMAP/GLOMAP isn‚Äôt always applied correctly. This causes the background image on the RS Camera to look distorted.
- **Fix**: Open **Render Settings ‚Üí Output**, and re‚Äëtype the output width or height. This forces Cinema 4D to update the film aspect ratio and restores the correct background image proportions.
